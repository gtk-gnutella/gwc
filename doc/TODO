TODO:

VERY IMPORTANT:

  - Complete documentation

IMPORTANT:

  - blacklist for manual constant removal (URLs, vendors, versions)
  - more checks for duplicates (compare IPs to prevent dyndns squatting)
  - escape binary data in all log messages
  - verify and test the code regarding set{g,u}id(), chroot() thoroughly
  - Queue URL checks, so that re-verifications are handled with a higher
    priority than new URLs.

LESS IMPORTANT:

  - verify peers by initiating a connect as Gnutella leaf [by Raphael Manfredi]
  - readv/writev-like interface for the FIFOs to minimize copying
  - maintain bandwidth counters per hour, day and total [by Raphael Manfredi]
  - optional bandwidth limiting [by Raphael Manfredi]
  - re-do the OOP-like stuff to have less coding overhead
  - add an option/feature to submit the URL to other GWCs to get it started
    [by Jeroen Asselman]
  - add a feature to sync a group of Crabs so that all updates are
    distributed to the whole group [by Raphael Manfredi]
 
GIMMICK:
  
  - support Transfer-Encoding gzip
  - dynamically {de,in}crease the number of returned peers and URLs
    depending on the current request and update rates i.e., return more
    if the rates increase to decrease the overall rate.
  - stats per client and version
